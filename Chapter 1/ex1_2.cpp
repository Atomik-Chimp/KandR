/* This runs on Visual Studio 2010 */
/* as an ugly mix of C and C++ */

/* Visual Studio 2010 got angry about not including "stdafx.h" and precompiled headers */
#include "stdafx.h"

#include <stdio.h>

/* Visual Studio 2010 requires a main return type */
/* won't let me have more than one main function (not surprising) */
int main(){

	printf("Hello World!\n");

	/* note there is no pause, so the console window closes right away */
	/* But it does appear to work */
}
